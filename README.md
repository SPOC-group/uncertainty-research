* Analysis of Bootstrap and Subsampling in High-dimensional Regularized Regression : [Link to paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2402.13622), [Github repo](https://github.com/SPOC-group/BootstrapAsymptotics)

* Building Conformal Prediction Intervals with Approximate Message Passing : [Link to paper](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.16493?), [Github repo](https://github.com/SPOC-group/ConformalAmp.jl)

**Remarks on the code** The codes are written in Python, Julia or Rust. Rust code requires compilation into a Python package, the instructions are provided in [this repository](https://github.com/SPOC-group/double_descent_uncertainty). 

# Work on ensembling 

* The folder `ensembling` contains : codes and reports regarding ensembling in the context of random feature models, see Chapter 6 of Lucas Clarte's manuscript in `clarte_phd.pdf`. The files `ensembling_files.zip` and `ensembling_output.pdf` contains the notes on this model. The sub-folder `random-features` contains experiments on ensembling random features.

# Work on mean-variance estimators

* Unpublished work on mean-variance estimators : [Github repo](https://github.com/AdamAved/SpecializationSPOC2025). The folder `mean-variance` contains Adam's report on this model. 

#Â Misc 

* The folder `double-descent` contains numerical experiments to observe a double descent phenomenon in the calibration curve on real datasets.
